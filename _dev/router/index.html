                  This is a demonstration of how to implement a simple CSS-based
                  router for a static Single Page Application (SPA).

            <div class="page">
               <h2>Page transitions</h2>
               <p>
                  To make the page transitions less choppy, a slight fade-in
                  transition is used.

                  Since this method of using only CSS requires all content to be
                  placed in one file, it is only suitable for very small
                  projects that do not require many pages.

                  <h2>Duck Takes Ball to the Face</h2>

                  <p>
                     A duck was left stunned after it failed to duck a ball and
                     was hit in the face. The incident occurred at a local park,
                     where the duck was waddling along the edge of the pond. A
                     group of children were playing nearby, and one of them
                     threw a ball at the duck. The duck was not expecting the
                     ball and did not have time to react. The ball hit the duck
                     in the face, knocking it to the ground.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     The duck was uninjured, but it was shaken up by the
                     experience. It quickly recovered and waddled away, quacking
                     angrily. The children who threw the ball were laughing, but
                     they quickly realized that they had hurt the duck. They
                     apologized to the duck and promised to be more careful in
                     the future.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     The incident has sparked a debate about the ethics of
                     throwing balls at ducks. Some people believe that it is
                     cruel to do so, while others believe that it is simply a
                     harmless prank. The duck in this story was not seriously
                     injured, but it is important to remember that ducks are
                     living creatures and should be treated with respect.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     If you are ever tempted to throw a ball at a duck, please
                     think twice. It is not worth the risk of hurting the duck,
                     even if it is just a small prank. There are many other ways
                     to enjoy playing with ducks without putting them at risk.
